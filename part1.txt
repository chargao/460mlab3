Requirements
Interpreting the client's needs, stating them in a formal manner. Input is client's needs, output is a requirements doc. Tool is word processor. 

Design Specifications
Based on the requirements, determine the FPGA to use, other hardware specs, etc. Input is a requirements doc, output is SRS (System Requirements Specification). Tool used is any word processor/text editor. 

Design Entry (VHDL, Verilog, Schematic Capture)
Commit the design to code/schematic, whether through HDL or schematic capture (old-school). HDL candidates are Verilog (what we use in this class) and VHDL (what we used in EE316). Input is SRS, output is HDL files. Tool we use is ModelSim.

Simulation
Simulation is essentially testing in software to confirm that the design functions as expected. Input is HDL files and .do files, output is waveforms. Tool we use is ModelSim. 

Logic Synthesis
Converting high-level description into gates, flip-flops, etc, similar to a compilation step. Input is HDL files, output is netlist. Tool we use is Vivado. 

Post Synthesis Simulation
Once again testing the design, this time taking into account the limitations of hardware / timing. Input is netlist, output are reports. Tool we use is Vivado.

Mapping, Placement, Routing
These steps move the hardware design onto an actual FPGA/some other hardware. Input is netlist, output is bitstream. Tool is Vivado. 

FPGA Programming Unit
Writing the bitstream to program an actual FPGA. Input is bitstream, output is JTAG. Tool is vivado.

Configured FPGAs
Input is JTAG. Output is the FPGA board. Tool is Vivado. 

ASIC Masks (unused)
If we were using ASIC (custom hardware), then an ASIC mask is the wire traces. We do not use these in EE460M.
